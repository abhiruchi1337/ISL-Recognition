## Files:
* ISL-Recognition Code:
  * surf_processing.py - contains convenience function _descriptor()_ that takes a single image, performs skin masking and SURF detection and returns the descriptors.
  * surf_training.py - performs training on four models (SVM, Naive Bayes, KNN, Logistic regression) on the dataset of ISL images by calling descriptor() function for each image, training the cluster model (MiniBatchKMeans) to learn the visual vocabulary and predict histograms for each image. Stores each module as 'model_trained.sav' (e.g. 'svm_trained.sav'). Also stores the trained cluster model as 'cluster_model.sav'.
  * ISLVideo.py - uses the saved models 'svm_trained.sav' and 'cluster_model.sav' generated by surf_training.py on to video frames and gives output.
* Output
  * screenshots - test runs of program for some letters.
  * results - contains generated graphs, classifier outputs in csv format, learning curves and accuracy screenshots.
